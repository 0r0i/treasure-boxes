Click-Through-Rate Prediction Template
===

Cost Per Acquisition (CPA) is a key metric that matters to marketers. To reduce costs of online advertising, it is needed to improve **Click-Through-Rate (CTR)**.

Our machine learning solution enables you to predict CTR of each ad session by learning a prediction model from past big data, from millions of attributes and billions of training examples.

## Input

For instance, this workflow takes a table of the following form:

| rowid<br/>`long` | label<br/>`int` | i1<br/>`int` | i2<br/>`int` | ... | c1 (e.g., address) <br/>`string` | c2 (e.g., browser) <br/>`string` | ... |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| 1 | 0 | 23 | 1 | ... | "Ohio" | "Firefox" | ... |
| 2 | 1 | 18 | 4 | ... | "New York" | "Google Chrome" | ... |
| 3 | 0 | 35 | 44| ... | "California" | "Safari" | ... |
| ... |...|...| ...|...|...|...|...|

Here, each row represents user's single impression for an ad. Impressions can be written by a set of `int` (quantitative) and `string` (categorical) variables such as users' demographics. A column `label` shows whether a user clicked an ad.

## Workflow

We prepared a basic workflow for CTR prediction:

```sh
$ ./data.sh # prepare data
$ td wf run predict_logress -p apikey={YOUR_API_KEY}
```

* [predict_logress.dig](predict_logress.dig) - TD workflow script for CTR prediction using [Logistic Regression](https://hivemall.incubator.apache.org/userguide/binaryclass/a9a_lr.html)
* [config/params.yml](config/params.yml) - defines configurable parameters for the prediction.
  
## Output

The output of workflow is a table that contains predicted CTRs for possible future impressions:

| rowid<br/>`long` | predicted_ctr<br/>`double` |
|:---:|:---:|
|80038 |0.487177|
|80043|0.9583734|
|80046 | 0.9104515 | 
| ... | ... |

## Using the Prediction Model in Production System

Once the prediction workflow has been successfully completed, exporting the prediction model to your own MySQL database is easy:

1. Configure your MySQL DB information in [config/secrets.yml](config/secrets_sample.yml)
2. Load the information to TD workflow:<br/>`$ td wf secrets --local --set @config/secrets.yml`
3. Export a `logress_model` table to your MySQL DB:<br/>`$ td wf run mysql -p apikey={YOUR_API_KEY}`

***Note:*** *Make sure a table `logress_model` exists on your MySQL DB as follows.*

```sql
create table logress_model (
  feature int,
  weight double
);

-- setting index would be better
create unique index logress_model_feature_index on logress_model (feature);
```

That's it. Now, you are ready to predict CTRs for unforeseen impressions.

We prepared some MySQL user-defined-functions (UDFs) in [mysql_udfs.sql](mysql_udfs.sql):

```
mysql> mysql_udfs.sql
```

Prediction for single impression can be done by:

```sql
select
  sigmoid(sum(m.weight * t2.value)) as prob
from
  logress_model m
  left outer join (
    select
      extract_feature(f) as feature,
      extract_value(f) as value
    from (
      select 'quantitative_feature_1:value_1' as f
      union all
      select 'quantitative_feature_2:value_2' as f
      union all
      ...
      union all
      select 'categorical_feature_1' as f
      union all
      select 'categorical_feature_2' as f
      union all
      ...
    ) t1
  ) t2 on (m.feature = t2.feature)
;
```

In particular, when a user visits to a site, what your ad server needs to do is:

1. Convert all possible ads to sets of quantitative and categorical features.
2. Construct queries as shown above and compute predicted CTRs.
3. Display highest-scored ad(s) to the target user.
