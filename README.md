# Treasure Workflow Examples

This is a public repository of example workflows for the Treasure Workflow engine.

It is referred to by the [Workflow Examples](https://docs.treasuredata.com/articles/workflows-examples) page in the Treasure Data Online documentation.

## Publishing Examples

In order to publish new example or updates to existing example, simply commit the changes to the master branch, either by:
* direct commit to the master branch
* creating a topic branch, committing the changes to the topic branch, issuing a PR against the master branch, and merging the PR (squash-merge ok as well)

The latter method is best suited if you want your changes to be peer reviewed.
